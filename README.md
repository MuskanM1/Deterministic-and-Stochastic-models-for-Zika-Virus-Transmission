# Deterministic-and-Stochastic-models-for-Zika-Virus-Transmission

Transmission of Zika virus is the cause for one of the most widespread mosquito-borne diseases. Aedes-aegypti mosquito is the major contributor for the spread among the Aedes-type mosquitos.  We consider a sample space of a population of healthy humans. In this case, there is no disease and hence no outbreak of any infectious disease since everyone is healthy. Consider a situation where a small subset of the population is infected by a virus. Now, the rest of the population comes under the category of "susceptible" since they can catch the disease from the infected person/s. One after other susceptible humans become infected humans at a rate. We assume that once the disease has prevailed in a body, it cannot affect it again because the person has either become immune to it (chickenpox) or has died from it. In both cases, the person gets removed from the sample space of susceptible and infected humans. Everyone will either recover or die from the disease once they have caught it, and thus, it will end the pandemic in a definite time depending on the rate of spreading. There may be people who don't get sick at all. To study this we study the dynamical system to observe how state variables change with time. We have different rates of change and increments for different variables.
